/* coach-defense.jsx — Defense Room: a practice room for dissertation defenses,
   poster sessions, and research talks. Replaces the old Workspace page slot.
   Exports window.CoachDefenseRoom.

   Backend-integrated practice modes:
   1. "Answer questions" uses public academic profiles and uploaded materials.
   2. "Present your slides" records the talk, then generates committee questions.

   Backend-required for real committee profile lookup and question generation:
   - uploaded materials get parsed server-side and seed the question generator
   - real committee questions come from /api/defense/questions
   - voice uses the backend TTS/STT pipeline instead of browser speechSynthesis */
